# My Coding Portfolio 🧑‍💻📚

Hi! I'm Varun Kumar Arivuvel, a student learning to code using Python.  
This is a collection of my favorite projects — games, tools, and fun logic exercises!

 🧩 Projects

 1. [Mystic Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/yourusername/mystic-number-guessing-game)
A fun console guessing game built in Python.  
**Skills used**: input handling, random number generation, game logic.

 3. [Employee Management](https://github.com/your-username/employee-management/blob/main/employee_management.py)
A simple Python program to manage employees — add, view, and delete employee records using a console menu.

**Skills used**: Python functions for organizing code
Using dictionaries to store employee data , Handling user input and menu choices ,Conditional logic for flow control,Loops for continuous menu display, Basic error checking and messages, Simple text-based user interface

3 . [Varun & co Payslip Generator](https://github.com/your-username/repo-name/blob/main/employee_payslip_generator.py)
A simple Python console program that generates an employee payslip based on their name, employee ID, month/year, and days worked. It calculates salary earned from a fixed monthly salary and prints a formatted payslip in the console.

**Skills used**:  Basic arithmetic calculations, using variables to store and manipulate data, string formatting with f-strings, printing formatted text in the console, defining and calling functions, simple program flow and user interaction.


# Triangle Pattern Generator

This is a simple Python program that prints a right-angled triangle pattern using asterisks (`*`), based on the number entered by the user.

## 🔧 How It Works

FizzBuzz in Python
This simple Python script prints the numbers from 1 to 30. But for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

1. The program asks the user to enter a number (e.g., 5).
2. It then prints a triangle with that many rows:
